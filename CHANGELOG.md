## 2.0.0-beta1 (2018-11-21)

* server: Complete rewrite:
  * Remove cheshire3/sqlite with
  * Add a unified postgresql database for all content
  * Upgrade to Python3
* tokenisation: Defined tokenisation scheme based on unicode standard rules, used both for queries and importing books, see server/clic/tokenizer.py
* tokenisation: Any surrounding punctuation is filtered from types, thus searching for "connisseur" will return tokens "connisseur" and "_connisseur_" [BREAKING CHANGE]
* concordance: Wildcards can now be used in queries, e.g. "he * her hair", "Oliver*"
* concordance: Search is now for exact types. "Oliver" will no longer return "Oliver's" results, you must explicitly enter "Oliver*" [BREAKING CHANGE]
* region: Re-defined region tagging based on unicode standard rules, used when importing books, see server/clic/region
* region: Initial text between parts and chapters is now part of the previous chapter, instead of being in it's own chapter. This will reduce chapter counts for books broken up into parts. [BREAKING CHANGE]
* text: Shows book content verbatim from corpora repo, allows copy and paste
* text: Hide embedded suspensions, since we no longer mark them up
* cluster: Clusters now ignores boundaries, and only pays attention to token order. i.e. clusters can span adajcent quotes, but not chapters (as the title is in the way) [BREAKING CHANGE]
* migrate: Pull corpora information directly from corpora.bib
* keyword: Click on keyword clusters to see concordance lines
* concordance: Support single-character ? as well as *, e.g. "To the ?th degree"
