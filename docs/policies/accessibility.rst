Accessibility
=============

We aim to make the CLiC website as easy to use and as accessible as possible for all users. Our aim is that the site will meet the recommended government standard for web accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA). This means that you should be able to:

* change the colours, contrast levels, and fonts
* resize the text to make it easier to read
* navigate the site using just a keyboard or using speech recognition software
* listen to the content using a screen reader

If you wish to contact us about the accessibility of the CLiC website please email us at clic@contacts.birmingham.ac.uk
